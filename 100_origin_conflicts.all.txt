These data points suggest the invalidity might be due to a business relationship, transfer of IP resources that is not yet reflected in RPKI data, or a misconfiguration. While there is no direct AS relationship according to CAIDA data, the shared presence in the Philippines and the IRR records for both ASes make it medium likelihood that it's a benign misconfiguration. A more recent ROA update would be definitive but is not available in the provided context. Also, AS395793 announces more specifics of the announced prefix, and descr field of AS395793's IRR record matches the descr field of AS32402's IRR record, which provides a little more evidence of a relation between AS32402 and AS395793, thus AS17941 and AS32402 could also be related through AS395793.",

AS32402 might have previously been announcing the prefix and has since delegated it to AS17941, but the ROA has not been updated accordingly.

I am assigning it a \"Medium\" rating because the transfer history for the announced prefix shows that 31.56.0.0/14, which includes the announced prefix, was transferred between different holders, suggesting a possible business relationship exists. Additionally, the route objects in IRR indicate that the prefix had been originated by AS20473 at some point (last modified date indicates a recent issue), which hints that there may be some confusion or coordination problem in the origin.",
  "possible_reason": "The invalid announcement might be due to a misconfiguration during a network migration or re-delegation event.

It's a medium likelihood because, despite the lack of direct AS relationship, the geographical proximity (geolocation data for AS137443 includes locations in France where this /23 is geolocated), AS137443 announcing a less specific prefix of 154.223.0.0/16, and AS203020 announcing more specifics prefixes under 154.223.144.0/20 suggests a potential (though unconfirmed) business relationship or operational coordination, but the transfer history data did not provide extra information to analyze their relationships.",
  "possible_reason": "The invalid announcement could be due to a misconfiguration where AS137443 is supposed to announce more specifics of a less specific prefix (154.223.144.0/20) covered by AS203020's ROA or traffic engineering. The AS path also contains duplicates of the origin AS, indicating potential AS path manipulation, potentially in order to influence routing policy of upstream AS."

Ltd.' and 'XDCPLUSA Jiangsu Cloud Together Information Technology Co. Ltd.', respectively. All three ASes are located in Jiangsu Province, China. This suggests a potential business relationship or some form of coordination. CAIDA data shows AS4134, a China Telecom backbone AS, is a provider of AS23650. It's possible that AS63677 and AS63679, being cloud-related, are customers of AS23650 or connected to them in some way. The fact that the authorized ASes haven't announced any prefixes recently may indicate a change in their operational status, yet the origin AS still maintains them and their prefix. Without more explicit information about the relationship between these ASes, the likelihood of this being a benign origin conflict is assigned 'Medium'.",

  "explanation": "The RPKI invalid route 103.138.165.0/24 is announced by AS23923, while the ROA authorizes AS139026 to originate this prefix. RIPEstat data shows that AS139026 (Shadhinota Net) is located in Bangladesh, and the prefix is also geolocated to Bangladesh. Furthermore, the IRR data shows that AS139026 has registered route objects for both 103.138.164.0/23 and 103.138.165.0/24. The AS path contains 139026, indicating that 139026 might be involved in the route origination. The multiple occurence of 150748 and 139026 in the path, combined with the fact that AS23923 is also located in Bangladesh, suggests a potential customer-provider or other business relationship where AS23923 might be advertising the prefix on behalf of or in conjunction with AS139026. RIPEstat data shows that AS23923 announces a variety of prefixes and has been doing so since 2000, which suggests that it is probably not spoofing. The CAIDA data does not show a direct customer-provider relationship between AS23923 and AS139026. However, given the evidence, it is likely that the origin AS is announcing the prefix on behalf of AS139026, possibly due to a peering or transit agreement, which could represent a benign origin conflict. The BGP looking glass data provides AS paths to 139026 that contain 150748, consistent with the path in the announcement, which provides further confidence that the issue is not an outright spoof. The fact that AS139026 is consistently advertising the prefix at the time of the analysis further suggests it is legitimately using the IP space. Given that AS139026 announces the prefix as well, it is very probable that AS23923 is announcing it on their behalf, and is therefore considered High likelihood of benign intent.",
  "possible_reason": "Traffic engineering or backup arrangement: AS23923 might be advertising the prefix to provide a more preferred path or as a backup in case of issues with AS139026's primary connection. It could also be a misconfiguration or an outdated agreement where AS23923 was previously authorized but the ROA was not updated after a change in the network setup, or AS23923 announcing the prefix on behalf of AS139026 due to a commercial agreement."

Furthermore, the 'routing_status' field in the RIPEstat JSON for the prefix 103.27.24.0/22 shows both AS17816 and AS58834 as origins at different times. Also, CAIDA data shows AS4837 as a provider of AS17816, and AS4837 appears in the AS path.

This creates an RPKI invalid announcement. While AS56124 is not the authorized origin AS, the RIPEstat data shows both AS56124 and AS58765 are located in India and announce the prefix 115.124.40.0/24 and the aggregate 115.124.40.0/21 respectively. The IRR records also show both AS56124 and AS58765 registered the route objects for prefix 115.124.40.0/24 and aggregate 115.124.40.0/21 respectively. Furthermore, historical transfer data indicates AS58765 (BTEL) acquired resources from AS58765 (formerly NIXI/BITTEL), suggesting a change in business structure or ownership. Considering the geographical proximity, and the historical context in the IRR records, it is highly likely that AS56124 has a close relationship (possibly customer-provider, or a business unit) with AS58765. Also, CAIDA relationship data shows that AS56124's provider is AS45820 which appear in the AS path. Moreover, AS58765 is announcing the prefix 115.124.40.0/24 at the time 2025-07-06T08:00:00.

Both ASes, AS24554 (Microscan Internet Limited) and AS135848 (Digitax India Communications Pvt Ltd.), are located in India. While the prefix is covered by the ROA, the origin AS is different.

The authorized ROA covers a broader prefix (45.127.200.0/22) that includes the announced prefix (45.127.203.0/24). Given both ASes are operating in India, and the similar business (telecommunications), it's possible that there's an unrecorded business relationship or an error in AS origination.

Another possibility is traffic engineering, where AS137000 is temporarily announcing the prefix to influence traffic flow, however, this is less likely given the strict origin validation context of RPKI."

The RIPEstat data shows that AS151713 announced this prefix from 2024-08-30 to 2025-04-30.  The IRR records also indicate AS151713 as the origin. The routing status shows AS135799 announces this prefix at the last seen time. CAIDA shows that AS135799 has AS4755 and AS150596 as providers. The AS path shows AS135799 peers with AS150596. Further, AS151713 and AS135799 are both located in India. There isn't enough evidence to conclude a definite customer-provider relationship between AS135799 and AS151713. The origin AS changed from AS151713 to AS135799, so it is a possible misconfiguration or a planned change that was not updated in the ROA. Since both are located in India, there's a moderate possibility of a business relationship or coordination, but without more evidence, it's difficult to be certain. The fact that AS151713 previously announced the prefix lends some credence to a possible business arrangement.",

AS path contains 4755 before AS134319. This is an indication that AS134319 is likely announcing its provider's prefix, which could be the result of a customer-provider relationship misconfiguration.
